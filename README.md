## Challenge Statement

In this challenge, participants will **enhance an AI/ML classifier or clusterer using Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs)**.  
You will be provided with:
- A set of public datasets.
- Starter code in this repository.

Your mission: **Finish and innovate on the starter code** (or create your own approach) to develop quantum-enhanced machine learning models that meet the evaluation standards.

> **Focus Areas:** Performance, explainability, fairness, security, robustness, and innovation.

---

## Submission

Your submission must contain the code you used to train your model, model weights and a demo script if applicable (.pt files or similar is great), a write up describing what you did and how you did it, and optionally a short video demo and presentation.

You are not required to use the sample code provided but **please make a public fork of the repository for your submission.**

Feel free to try any combination of classification, clustering, supervised/unsupervised learning, unique backpropagation techniques, quantum circuit designs, etc.

---

## Sample Code

Our sample code for a VQA classifier will be available in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/UN-ICC/FLIQ-Virtual-Hackathon).  

Use them as a foundation or as inspiration but don't be afraid to innovate or try your own unique solution.

Keep in mind you will need to be using an environment capable of running torch or a similar ML library and qiskit. Additionally, as of 2025, qiskit has just moved to 2.x.x, meaning deprecated code is common and documentation/functionality can differ between versions.
