# Quantum-Enhanced Income Prediction

## üöÄ Overview

This project implements a quantum-classical hybrid model for predicting income levels (above or below $50K annually) using the UCI Adult Income dataset. By leveraging the power of quantum computing through PennyLane and PyTorch, we've created a model that achieves **83.59%** validation accuracy with impressively rapid convergence.

## üìä Performance Metrics

Our model achieved:
- **Validation Accuracy: 83.59%** (reached in first epoch and remained stable)
- **Fairness Metrics**:
  - Sex disparate impact ratio: 0.8316 (‚úÖ above fairness threshold)
  - Race disparate impact ratio: 0.8632 (‚úÖ above fairness threshold)
- **Model Convergence**: Rapid convergence to peak performance
- **Group Performance**: Notably high performance across minority demographic groups

## üß† Model Architecture

### Quantum Circuit Design

Our implementation uses a 4-qubit quantum circuit with several innovations:
- **Data re-uploading**: Feature values encoded twice for enhanced expressivity
- **Strongly entangling layers**: Two distinct variational blocks with 3 layers each
- **Efficient parametrization**: (2, 3, 4, 3) weight shape for optimal expressivity vs. trainability

### Loading the trained model

```python
# Define model architecture first (see notebook)
model = EnhancedHybridModel()
checkpoint = torch.load('quantum_model_final.pt')
model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])
model.eval()

# Make predictions
with torch.no_grad():
    prediction = model(input_tensor)
```

## üí° Key Innovations

1. **Rapid Convergence Architecture**: Our model achieved peak performance in the first epoch and maintained it

2. **Fairness-Aware Design**: The model shows excellent performance across demographic groups, exceeding fairness thresholds for both gender and race

3. **Quantum-Classical Balance**: Enhanced classical components complement the quantum circuit to maximize expressive power while maintaining trainability

4. **Efficient Quantum Design**: Our circuit uses data re-uploading with only 4 qubits, balancing quantum expressivity and training efficiency

## üîç Future Directions

- Explore quantum feature maps beyond RY encoding
- Better Classical Neural Networks Architecture
- Investigate larger qubit counts as quantum hardware improves
- Develop quantum advantage metrics specific to tabular data
- Research quantum-specific fairness constraints
- Enhancing Accuracy and Scalability
